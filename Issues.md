**Resolution:** Fixed by ensuring all image assets are properly formatted and have valid MIME types. Updated the image loading process to handle null buffers gracefully.

## Logical Application Errors (Fixed)

~~We need to be able to select what customer the stopwatch is for, additionally we need the webapp to be able to handle storing the data long term.~~

**Resolution:** 
1. Added customer selection dropdown to the stopwatch component
2. Implemented persistent storage using AsyncStorage for local data retention
3. Added data export functionality for long-term storage and backup
