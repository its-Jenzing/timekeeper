Time account app    

The goal of this app is to allow me to account for time that I have worked, I want a simple app that I can account time for a company that my IT buisness is charging them. 

I want a base app first, that is what we will be building then The app will be running the app later down development line to a server, the server is to allow me to run it on my pc as well! We will base this on expo/react


I want to have the following screens

A Clock stop watch to start and end time




Customer
customer data entry, with a billing contact.

I want to export the time I have worked and for the buisness in a nice looking PDF for my boss.
